# DnsTube

A Windows client for dynamically updating Cloudflare DNS entries with your public IP address.

## Building

This solution was built using Visual Studio 2019. It's probably best to use that version. The Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects extension was used to make the Setup project work in VS2019.
